        <p>This site was created by Sebastian Szuch for the final project of Advanced Programming.</p>
        <p>It was created to provide helpful resources to current and interested students while offering a unique and simple interface.</p>
        <p>This site only provides resources. None of the content within the external links was created by me.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the icons seen on this page were created by itch.io user aconfuseddragon
            and can be found <a href="https://aconfuseddragon.itch.io/windows-95-plus-1">here</a>.
